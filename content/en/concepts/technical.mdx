# Technical Concepts

## Core Concepts

### Optimization
Process of finding best solution according to objective function.

### Objective Function / Reward Function
Mathematical specification of what we want AI to optimize.

### Training vs Deployment
- **Training**: Phase where AI learns
- **Deployment**: Phase where AI operates in real world

### Distributional Shift
When deployment environment differs from training environment.

## Alignment Concepts

### Base Optimizer
Outer process that trains the AI (e.g., gradient descent).

### Mesa-Optimizer
Inner optimizer that emerges within trained model.

### Pseudo-alignment
Model appears aligned but isn't truly aligned.

## Safety Concepts

### Robustness
AI performs correctly under distribution shift.

### Adversarial Examples
Inputs designed to fool AI.

### Red-teaming
Testing AI with adversarial prompts.
