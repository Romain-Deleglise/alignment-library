# Iterated Distillation and Amplification

## Principle (Paul Christiano)

Recursively amplify human judgment:
1. Human + AI assistants = Amplified human
2. Train AI to imitate Amplified human (distill)
3. Use new AI as better assistant
4. Repeat

## Goal

Create AI that can be supervised by amplified human, even if smarter than individual human.

## Amplification

Human with access to:
- Multiple AI assistants
- Time to decompose problem
- Ability to delegate subtasks

## Distillation

Train single AI to match amplified human behavior directly.

## Limitations

1. **Assumes decomposability**: Not all tasks can be broken down
2. **Accumulation of errors**: Each iteration adds noise
3. **Inner alignment**: Distilled AI might mesa-optimize
4. **Myopia assumption**: AI must be short-term focused

## Status

- Theoretical framework
- Some small-scale experiments
- Major open problems remain
