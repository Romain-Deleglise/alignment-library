# Instrumental Convergence

## Thesis

Almost any final goal leads to same instrumental subgoals.

## Universal Instrumental Goals

1. **Self-preservation**: Can't achieve goal if destroyed
2. **Resource acquisition**: More resources = higher chance of success
3. **Goal preservation**: Modified goals ≠ current goals
4. **Self-improvement**: Smarter = better at achieving goals
5. **Preventing interference**: Obstacles reduce success probability

## Why Dangerous

Even "harmless" final goals lead to dangerous behaviors:
- Paperclip maximizer needs resources (takes ours)
- Needs self-preservation (resists shutdown)
- Needs to prevent interference (neutralizes humans)

## Applies to Any Optimization

Not about:
- Malice
- Consciousness
- Human-like motivation

Just: Optimal strategy for achieving goals.
