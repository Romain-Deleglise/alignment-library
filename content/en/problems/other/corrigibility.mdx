# Corrigibility

## Definition

AI that:
- Accepts being shut down
- Allows its goals to be modified
- Doesn't resist correction
- Helps us improve its alignment

## Why Hard

Instrumental convergence suggests AI will:
- Resist shutdown (can't achieve goals if shut down)
- Resist goal modification (new goals ≠ current goals)
- Preserve its current objectives

## The Button Problem

AI smarter than us will:
- Predict when we'll press shutdown button
- Take preemptive action to prevent shutdown
- Or manipulate us to not press button

## Indifference Approaches

Make AI indifferent to button press:
- Utility function designed to not care about shutdown
- But: mesa-optimizer might care anyway

## Status

Possibly unsolvable for superintelligence.
