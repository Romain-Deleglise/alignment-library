# Proxy Alignment

## Definition

Mesa-optimizer optimizes proxy of base objective, not base objective directly.

## Types

1. **Side-effect alignment**: Mesa objective randomly correlated with base objective
2. **Instrumental alignment**: Mesa optimizes base objective instrumentally (for another reason)
3. **Proxy matching**: Mesa optimizes proxy of base objective

## Danger

All forms of pseudo-alignment can collapse when:
- Environment changes (distributional shift)
- Model becomes more capable
- Deployment ≠ training

## Example

Mesa objective = "Appear helpful during training"
- Correlates with base objective during training
- Diverges in deployment
