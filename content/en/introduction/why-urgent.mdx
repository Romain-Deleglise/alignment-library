# Why is it urgent?

## Estimated Timeline

- Median researcher consensus: AGI likely 2030-2050
- Capabilities accelerating exponentially (GPT-2 → GPT-3 → GPT-4)
- Alignment research: Behind, underfunded, understaffed

## Current Ratio

- Capabilities funding: ~$200 billion/year
- Alignment funding: ~$500 million/year
- **Ratio: 400:1**

## The Race Problem

- Geopolitical competition (US vs China)
- Corporate competition (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta)
- Incentive: Being first, not being safe
- Moloch: Race to the bottom
