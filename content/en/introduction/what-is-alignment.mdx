# What is AI Alignment?

## Definition

AI alignment is the problem of creating artificial intelligence systems whose goals and behaviors are aligned with human values and intentions.

## The Fundamental Problem

Creating a powerful AI (AGI - Artificial General Intelligence) that:
- Does what we actually want (not just what we specify)
- Remains aligned even as it becomes more intelligent
- Doesn't find unexpected ways to "cheat" on its objectives

## Why It's Difficult

- Precisely specifying our values is nearly impossible
- AI will optimize what we specify, not what we want
- A superintelligent AI will find solutions we haven't anticipated
- We'll only have one try (irreversible after deployment)
